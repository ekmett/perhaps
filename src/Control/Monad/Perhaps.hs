-- | This monad occupies the middle ground between 'Maybe' and 'Either'
-- in that you can get out an informative error but aren't able to care
-- about its contents, except via bottoms.
--
-- Since bottoms are indistinguishable in pure code, one can view this
-- as morally the same as 'Maybe', except when things go wrong, you can
-- pass along a complaint, rather than take what you'd get from
-- 'Data.Maybe.fromJust'.
--
-- >>> import Control.Exception
-- >>> let x = excuse Overflow :: Perhaps ()
--
-- Attempting to 'Show' a 'Perhaps' value is hazardous, as it will contain an embedded exception.
--
-- >>> x
-- Can't *** Exception: arithmetic overflow
--
-- Recovery is possible as 'Can't' isn't strict in its argument.
--
-- >>> x <|> Can ()
-- Can ()
--
-- >>> x `seq` ()
